Simple AI Program in C#
This is a simple AI program written in C# that utilizes decision-making using if-else statements. The program asks the user if they are happy and responds accordingly. If the user is happy, the program responds positively. If the user is not happy, the program asks if they want to talk about it. If the user wants to talk about it, the program asks what's bothering them and responds sympathetically. If the user does not want to talk about it, the program simply says goodbye.
